Hello, I'm John F. Wu!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University and Space Telescope Science Institute. I'm particularly interested in studying galaxies using deep learning and multiwavelength observations.

My [home page](https://jwuphysics.github.io) describes more of my astrophysics work, while this blog might be a bit more focused on deep learning.

Hello, I'm John F. Wu!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute. I'm particularly interested in studying galaxies using deep learning and multiwavelength observations. I have spent time at Johns Hopkins University (in same research group as my current one), Rutgers University (for my PhD), and Carnegie Mellon University (for my undergraduate degree).

My [home page](https://jwuphysics.github.io) describes more of my astrophysics work, while this blog might be a bit more focused on deep learning. Get in touch with me on Twitter ([@jwuphysics](https://twitter.com/jwuphysics)) or via email ([jwuphysics@gmail.com](mailto:jwuphysics@gmail.com)) if you want to chat!

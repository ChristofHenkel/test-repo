    "Two years ago, I was getting close to the end of my astrophysics PhD program. I had always been interested in statistical methods and machine learning, but never made the leap into deep learning territory. [Andrew Ng's legendary machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) was an excellent introduction to building simple neural networks from scratch, but I wasn't sure what to do next. What I really needed was an astrophysics research project! \n",
    "\n",
    "Around this time, I was fortunate enough to hear about the [Fast.ai \"Practical Deep Learning for Coders\" (2018) course](https://course.fast.ai/), which introduced deep learning using a top-down approach. The course also served as a guide for using the [Fastai codebase](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), which is built atop Pytorch. I also noticed that some Fastai users were interested in applying their knowledge to the [Kaggle GalaxyZoo classification challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge), which used galaxy image cutouts as their primary source of data. Since I was already interested in galaxy evolution, it seemed like a good idea to think about the types of problems that could be solved using similar data sets.\n",

    "We see galaxies as gravitationally bound collections of stars, gas, and dust. Galaxies grow by forming new stars out of cold gas, most of which is hydrogen, the lightest and most abundant element in the Universe. Over the course of the stars' lifetimes, heavy elements are fused and eventually strewn across the galaxy through a combination of stellar winds and supernova explosions. Since heavy elements can only be produced inside stars, the ratio of heavy-to-light element abundances is a key measurable for understanding the galaxy's history of star formation and gas accretion. This abundance ratio of heavy-to-light elements is known as the *metallicity*. Galaxies which have formed more stars tend to also have higher metallicity."

    "As we have discussed, it is well-known that galaxies' star formation and chemical evolution histories are connected.

Although it is observationally difficult to measure the metallicities of other galaxies, it is easy to measure their stellar masses.

In other words, the MZR does not represent the *intrinsic scatter* due to the physics of galaxy formation and evolution; rather, some of this scatter can be reduced by using other information such as the morphology. (Another possibility is that the galaxy's [star formation rate explains some of the scatter](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.408.2115M/abstract), and that we are instead leveraging this information, but this is unlikely given the fact that we do not study the blue/ultraviolet light from these galaxies.)"
